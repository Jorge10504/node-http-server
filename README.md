# Node.js Server

This project is meant to showcase the evolution of a web server built using Node.js as I study this technology in depth.

## Folder Structure

- `.gitignore`: This file is meant to track the files that the repo and server depend on without having to upload dependencies and large directories to the repo.

- `package.json`: This file provides an overview into the project details such as designated scripts and dependency names.

- `package-lock.json`: This file tracks the different dependencies in more detail and includes specific information such as URL location within the `npmjs` registry and specific dependency version.

- `server.js`: This is the file I am starting to use to evolve the server add different endpoints.
